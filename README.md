# Long's Portfolio Page

## Project Description
I built this portfolio from the ground up using React and Bootstrap. I wanted a simple page that allows the viewer to quickly find information about me. The site is currently not mobile friendly.

I decided against using a portfolio template because I wanted more freedom to be able to customize elements and to build upon it as I get more experience and learn new technologies.

## Future Goals
* Add an experience section once I am employed
* Add a contact me section consisting of a form that allows the viewers to message me
* Refactor the site to be mobile friendly
