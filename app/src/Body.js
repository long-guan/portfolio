                <p>My appreciation and curiosity of software grew when I worked as a civil engineer. During my civil engineering internship, I created an Excel sheet that greatly decreased the time required to design an ADA curb ramp. Then in my 3.5 years as a Design Engineer, I worked heavily with <a href="https://www.autodesk.ae/products/civil-3d/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription&plc=CIV3D">Autodesk Civil 3D</a>.

I completed the course and had a lot of fun. Then I started <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> in Feburary of 2022. Throughout 2022, I worked on the course while balancing my full time job as a Design Engineer. Even though I was tired after getting off work, I looked forward to learning more. I decided to quit my full time job as a Design Engineer in Feburary of 2023 to pursue software engineering. Around this time, I was able to create Battleship with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>
                <p>I studied full time and worked on The Odin Project after leaving my job. Around May of 2023, I joined a </p>
