        <p className="about-body">
          Since embarking on this journey, I have come to realize that software
          engineering is not only about finding a solution that works, but also
          about finding a solution that is efficient, user-centric, and
          cost-effective. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my
          problem-solving and collaborative skills developed in civil
          engineering to develop innovative, technically robust, and
          user-friendly software.
