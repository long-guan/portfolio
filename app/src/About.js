                <p>Through the four years of using <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="link" href="https://www.autodesk.ae/products/civil-3d/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription&plc=CIV3D">computer-aided design</a> as a civil engineer, I was always amazed by how it automated many processes and made my job much more efficient. Fueled by amazement and curiosity, I wanted to learn how to create software to automate a process. So, I completed an <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="link" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/">intro to Python course</a> on Udemy in 2021. I had a blast learning it and craved more, so I started <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="link" href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a>, an online fullstack web development course I worked on throughout 2022.</p>
                <p>Fast forward to February of this year, what started as amazement and curiosity led me to take a leap and make a career switch to become a software engineer. Since then, I have been self-learning and finished a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" className="link" href="https://www.galvanize.com/explore-hack-reactor-coding-bootcamps/">19-week full-stack software engineering bootcamp</a>. So far, I have HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, FastAPI, Django, Bootstrap, Git/GitHub, Docker, PostgreSQL under my belt and with plans to learn more.</p>
                <p>Outside of coding, I love snowboarding, camping, and editing GoPro videos of the trips I have been on.</p>
